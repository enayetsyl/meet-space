      MeetSpace, was founded in 2013 with a simple goal: to make booking meeting spaces effortless and efficient. It all started when our founder, John Doe, experienced firsthand the challenges of finding and reserving meeting rooms for his growing business. Frustrated with the outdated and cumbersome processes, he set out to create a platform that would transform the way people book spaces.
